# Simple Whisper 
Implements the Whisper model via the [Burn WGPU backend](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/blob/main/crates/burn-wgpu/README.md).

Based over [sudomonikers/whisper-burn](https://github.com/sudomonikers/whisper-burn), provides abstraction over different models and languages. 

Weights are automatically downloaded from [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/newfla/simple-whisper).
